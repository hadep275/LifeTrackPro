Additional Features:
1. Recurring Bills & Expenses:
Users should be able to add recurring bills and expenses with a frequency (weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.).

For each recurring bill, users should specify:

Bill Name

Amount

Due Date

Frequency (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)

The app will automatically add a new entry for the bill every week or month, based on the selected frequency.

2. Integration with the Calendar:
The recurring bills and expenses will be displayed on the calendar based on the due date and frequency.

For example, if a user adds a bill due on the 1st of every month, a new entry will be automatically added to the calendar on the 1st day of each month.

Similarly, for weekly bills, a new entry will appear every week on the correct day.

Updated Functionality Breakdown:
Recurring Bill Creation:

When the user creates a new bill or expense, they will have an option to set the recurrence frequency:

Weekly

Monthly

Custom (every X days)

The start date will be specified, and the app will automatically calculate when the next occurrence of the bill should be due.

Tracking Recurring Bills in the Calendar:

Each time a bill is added to the system, whether it's one-time or recurring, it will be added to the calendar on the relevant date.

The recurring bills will repeat automatically based on their frequency, and they will appear on the calendar each time they are due.

Tracking Payments for Recurring Bills:

Users should be able to mark recurring bills as paid when they pay them, and the app should adjust the bill’s status.

Optionally, you can show a visual reminder (like a checkmark) when the bill is marked as paid.

Prompt Update:
Here’s an updated prompt with the recurring bill functionality:
