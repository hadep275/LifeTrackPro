MVP for Comprehensive Task Manager, Habit Tracker, Goal Tracker, and Budgeting App:

Goal: Build a minimal viable product (MVP) for a full-stack task manager, habit tracker, goal tracker, net worth tracker, and budgeting app. The app will include the ability for users to track tasks, habits, goals, and finances, with a calendar view that displays their daily tasks and progress. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS. Do not use additional libraries or Firebase for now; focus on the core functionality and the layout of the app.

Key Functionalities:
User Interface Layout:

Home Page (Dashboard):

The homepage will include a task list, a habit tracker, a goal progress section, a net worth tracker, and a calendar that displays daily tasks and events.

Each section should have a mini-view with a few key metrics, and should be visually clean and minimalistic.

Task List Section:

Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.

Each task will have a title, due date, priority level (low, medium, high), and a progress tracker.

Tasks can be marked as completed.

Habit Tracker Section:

Users can add daily or weekly habits (e.g., exercise, reading).

Track whether theyâ€™ve completed the habit each day. Use a simple checkbox or toggle system.

Display progress for the habit over time.

Goal Tracker Section:

Users can add goals with a milestone system.

Track progress towards each goal (e.g., percentage complete).

Option to update milestones manually when achieved.

Net Worth Tracker:

Users can enter and track income, expenses, and savings.

Display the current net worth based on the entered data (e.g., balance = income - expenses).

Budget Tracker:

Users can add and track monthly income and expenses.

Visual representation of the budget (e.g., bar chart or list).

Calendar:

A simple calendar view where users can see their scheduled tasks and goals for the day.

Tasks should be clickable to edit or view more details.

Basic Functionality:

CRUD Operations:

Users should be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks, goals, habits, and financial data (expenses, income).

Progress Bars & Visual Feedback:

Display progress bars for tasks, habits, and goals to show how much has been completed.

Local Storage:

For now, store data using localStorage so that it persists when the user refreshes the page.

Data should not be shared between users (no authentication yet).

Styling (UI/UX):

Simple and Clean Design: Use a minimal, clean design approach. Focus on functionality over complexity.

The layout should be responsive to ensure it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Basic animations or transitions (e.g., smooth task completion or habit check-off).

Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout design.

React Components:

App Component: Main entry point that holds the routing logic and general layout.

TaskManager Component: Handles tasks (adding, deleting, marking as complete).

HabitTracker Component: Allows users to track habits.

GoalTracker Component: Manages goals and milestones.

NetWorthComponent: Displays the net worth and tracks financial data.

CalendarComponent: Displays the calendar view with task integration.

Interaction:

Users can add a task via an input form, with fields for task name, due date, priority, and completion status.

Tasks should be organized by the due date.

Habits can be marked as completed with a simple toggle or checkbox.

Goals should show progress based on milestones.

Expenses and income should be entered manually in the budget tracker, and the net worth should update automatically.
